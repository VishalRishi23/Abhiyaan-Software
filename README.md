# Abhiyaan-Software
Submission for Team Abhiyaan
============================
Name:
Vishal Rishi MK
Roll Number:
CH18B013
Previous Experience:
-------------------
I was involved in the Titanic dataset challenge in Kaggle, so that I could get started with Machine learning.
I also participated in the Smart India Hackathon 2020. My team V.A.N.T.R.S chose 'Detection and location of clouds in INSAT satellite images' as the problem statement. My team was selected for phase two of the selections. Unfortunately, we could not go beyond that.

Current PORs:
-------------
I am the Social Media Manager of the EdTech startup, TECHTABLE. 
I am also the coordinator of the events team, Tamil club, IITM.
Why I want to work in the team:
------------------------------
I am interested in Machine learning and Deep learning and I have just set my foot on the world of computer vision. I want to enhance my skills in this domain and I think the best way to do that is to work on projects. Since, Abhiyaan is working on autonomous vehicles, I am confident that this will be the right platform for me to boost my skills and also contribute to the team (a win-win situation!). I will also get to experience the fun of working with a team, filled with self-driven techies, that strives for a good cause.
Relevant Courses:
----------------
I am self-driven and hence, I prefer to teach myself all the concepts. I rely on books to learn Machine learning as I feel that they touch the base of the domain and build the foundation. One such book I have used is 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow' by Aurelien Geron.
