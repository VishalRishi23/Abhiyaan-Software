 The current model (YOLOv3) is not able to correctly predict the position of traffic lights. As an improvement, one could add a few more convolutional layers to the current YOLOv3 model and train it on the given set of images and it's annotations. During training, we should freeze the the model's original layers. Even after this strategy, if we could not get good results, we can try unfreezing some of the bottom layers and repeat the training with a lower learning rate so that the original weights do not get tarnished. The problem with this strategy is that it can be time consuming to train the model.
